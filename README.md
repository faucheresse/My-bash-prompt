# My-bash-prompt
That's my own bash prompt. You can use it and modify it as you want.


##If you want some colors in your bash and git information tou should try this one.
You just have to download the 'prompt' file, rename it as '.prompt', place it in your working
directory. Then you just have to add the following code at the end of your .bashrc and all will be done.

```
if [ -f ~/.prompt ]; then
    . ~/.prompt
fi
```
